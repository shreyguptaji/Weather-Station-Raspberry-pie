# Weather-Station-Raspberry-pie
This project will record temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor of the Raspberry Pi and log the data into a .csv file.

This uses the ADAFruit library which can be downloaded from here https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT which is a python library to read the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi. The program uses the log.write() function to store the collected data on humidity and temperature of the surroundings into a log file.
